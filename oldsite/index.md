# Welcome to my Github Page

## Why do I code?
I work in cybersecurity and just about anything information technology. My concern is that IT/Security professionals know
how to use a tool, but they do not know how the tool works. And with the advent of Machine Learning and A.I., I firmly 
believe there will no longer be a need for these "I.T. Professionals" and those who can maintain the A.I. will be 
highly valued.

## Other Interest
I like to think that I am a jack of all trades, of some sort. I love art and the idea of creating something from nothing. 
Art is like programming because you are given a canvas (computer), brush (hands), and paint (mind). Including art, I am 
an crypto enthusiast interested in everything Blockchain; and, literally everything "crypto" including encryption, cipher 
suites, obfuscation, etc. And if it is not cryptography related then I'm learning as much as I can about Artificial 
Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Complete Automation.
